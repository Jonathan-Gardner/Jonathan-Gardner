# Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Portfolio!
 
I'm Jon Gardner,

I have 10 years experience as a full stack interactive 3D and game programmer. I specialise in gameplay system architecture and high performance C#. I also enjoy working on low level networking, backend servers, designer tooling, and just about any problem that needs solving; Iâ€™m a jack of all trades!

## Projects:

I'm perpetually working on projects and finding new problems to hack at. **I live and breathe C#**

- Here's a few old ones that I think are neat.

| [<img src="./img/index/cubemaze.png" width="250"/>](image.png) | <div style="width:250px">**CubeMaze** is a simple maze game wrapped around a cube. While it's another example of an odd mesh I've had to generate at runtime, I think the much more intresting aspect is the maze generation itself.</div> |
