# Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Portfolio!
 
I'm Jon Gardner,

I have 10 years experience as a full stack interactive 3D and game programmer. I specialise in gameplay system architecture and high performance C#. I also enjoy working on low level networking, backend servers, designer tooling, and just about any problem that needs solving; Iâ€™m a jack of all trades!
