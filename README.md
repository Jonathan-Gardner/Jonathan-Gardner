# Hey There! ðŸ‘‹
 
I'm **Jon Gardner**,

I have 10+ years experience as a full stack interactive 3D and game programmer. I specialise in gameplay system architecture and high performance C#.
Professionally I've worked on:
 - Mobile Games
 - Desktop Games
 - Multiplayer Game Servers
 - Augmented and Virtual Reality
 - Server Achitectures & Microservices
 - Voice Apps
 - Winform & Terminal Dev Tools

And probably a dozen other types I'm forgetting, and on side projects?
I'm more or less perpetually finding new and intresting projects to hack away at.
